            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system where you can upload files and be able to log
            what they are each doing and view their history. You can also modify files and overwrite
            them with the new information provided. Version Control is useful for people in any field 
            and not just coders. Artists or architects can be able to upload their files if they would 
            like to communicate with others and collaborate with a team. It is also useful for backing up 
            files in case users don't want to use their local computer. They can easily load them with Version 
            Control and access them remotely.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that allows you to do just 
            about everything that I mentioned in the paragrpah above. It was created in 2005 for the developemnt 
            of Linux Kernels. It is very manageable if you want to be able to host large websites with lots of information 
            and data. With Git you can also remove files or remove them. I personally like it because 
            the learning curve is doable and it is friendly for non coders. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to get started with git you just need a couple commands and your files can be available 
            for Version control tracking. To get started you would need to up terminal and change directories in your project
            folder. After you have change directories you can now type git init which initializes the project. git add . will 
            add your folder contents to staging. git commit will commit your changes onto version control. Those simple three 
            steps are all you would need to be able to host your files remotely without having to worry about computer storage. 
            You can also load your teams files onto your machine through git. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local vs remote repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Local repositories are simply files you commit to your own computer and can access them 
            through terminal without internet conection. Your operating system already has a file management interface 
            so why would you use git for your local projects? Many people find it easy to log their history and view their 
            project changes and progress. Remote repositories make git a popular too. They allow people to create and view 
            their teammates projects with ease. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is a webased verion control system that also uses git. People can create accounts 
            and use the online platform for use. Github is able to give developers view of what everyone is working on
            through simple website viewing. I like using GitHub because it allows me to use websites instead of using 
            terminal. Github replaces the use for terminal commands and you can view the timestamp, file size, and last commit 
            that was just made in your repository</p>
